**Explanatory Notes

This slim package consists of a compilation of functions that help the user to implement basic jobs with data provided from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's 
Fatality Analysis Reporting System. A sample of the data is integrated with package to serve as a testing ground and appropriate documentation is present for both the functions and the data types, which can be accessed in the usual syntax form: ?"name of data or function".
